Who took the bomp?
Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see your disco disco dick
is sucking my heart out of my
mind
I'm outta time
I'm outta fucking time
I'm a gasoline gut with a
vasoline mind
but
Wanna disco?
Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my
rhyme
One
Two
Three
Four
You got what you been asking for
You're so policy free
and fantasy wheels
and everything you think
and everything you feel is
Alright,
alright
alright
alright
alright
I take you home now watch me
get you hot.
You're just a parrot
when you're screaming and
you're shouting
"More crackers please! More
crackers please!"
You want what you wan,
but you don't wanna be on your
knees
Who does your, who does your
hair?
Who took the Bomp from the
Bompalompalomp?
Who took the Ram from the
Ramalamading dong?
Who took the Bomp from the
Bompalompalomp?
Who took the Ram from the
Ramalamading dong?
How are you?
Fine, Thank you
How are you?
Fine, Thank you.
You bought a new van
the first year of your band
You're cool and
I hardly wanna say
"not" because I'm so bored
that'd I'd be entertained even
by a
stupid fucking linoleum floor
linoleum floor
Your lyrics are dumb like a
linoleum floor
I'll walk on it
I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it
walking one
two
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who took the Bomp from the
Bompalompalomp?
Who took the Ram from the
Ramalamading dong?
Who took the Bomp from the
Bompalompalomp?
Who took the Ram from the
Ramalamading dong?
See you later.
See you later.
See you later.
See you later.
