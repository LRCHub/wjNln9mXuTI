Who took the bomp?

Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see your disco, disco
Dick is sucking my heart out of my mind

I'm outta time, I'm outta fuckin' time
I'm a gasoline gut with a Vaseline mind but
Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme

One, two, three, four
You got what you been asking for
You're so policy free and your fantasy wheels
And everything you think and everything you feel is alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I take you home, now watch me get you hot
You're just a parrot and you're screaming and you're shouting
"More crackers please, more crackers please"
You want what you want but you don't wanna be on your knees
Who does your, who does your hair?

Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?

You bought a new van, the first year of your band
You're cool and I hardly wanna say, "Not"
Because I'm so bored that I'd be entertained
Even by a stupid fuckin' linoleum floor, linoleum floor
Your lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor

I'll walk on it
I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two
Who? Who? Who? Who?

Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?
